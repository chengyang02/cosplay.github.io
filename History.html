      <li> Although most people think cosplay is originally from Japan, cosplay initially began in the 1930s in North America, with a practice called costuming. At the time, the participants did not have to mimic the characters. The participants only dressed appropriately. </li>

      <p>The term ‘Cosplay’ is a combination of the words “costume” and “play.”Although it was invented in 1930, the term ‘Cosplay’ was not invented until 1984, by a Japanese reporter named <b>Nobuyuki Takahashi</b>. In 1984, Takahashi attended WorldCon in LA, California, and he reported on the masquerade. When he was translating the word 'masquerade' to Japan, he used 'Cosplay' to describe because the name was vintage. </p>
